This app allows users to manage a list of books with basic operations:

- 📚 Add new books
- ✏️ Edit existing books

## 🚀 Project Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Local State (Completed)

- Book data managed using React's local state (`useState`)
- No backend or data persistence — refresh clears the list
- Basic CRUD functionality implemented
- Random images from Lorem Picsum
- UI styled using Bulma CSS

### ⏳ Phase 2: API Integration (Upcoming)

- Add external API for persistent storage (CRUD with backend)

### 🔜 Phase 3: Centralized State (Upcoming)

- Introduce state management using Redux or React Context
- Centralized handling of API responses and UI updates
